# move_projects.py
This is a script to move all projects from one Snyk org to another. 

## Before you begin:
Ensure you are running a current version of Python.  You can get the latest version [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). <br>


Open Notepad or similar app and copy the following strings to use later:

**Current Org ID**

1. Get the Org ID of the Organization where your projects currently reside.

**Destination Org ID**

2. Switch to the destination Orgainization and repeat Step 1 to get the Org ID of the Organization where your projects will move to.


**Snyk API Token**

3. Finally, copy your Snyk API token.

## How to use:
1. Copy the file **move_projects.py** to your python environment. 
2. Run the file by typing **`python move_projects.py`** or **`python3 move_projects.py`** depending on the command to run Python 3 in your environment.
3. You will be asked to input your **Current Org ID**, **Destination Org ID**, and **Snyk API Token**. (You can just paste these in)
4. The script will move all projects to the new org and remove them from the current org.  It should look similar to this:

response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=headers, data=payload)


response_dict = response.json()

proj_count=0
while response_dict['data']:
  project = response_dict['data'].pop()
  current_project=project['id']
  current_proj_name=project['attributes.name']
  url = "https://snyk.io/api/v1/org/"+current_org+"/project/"+current_project+"/move"
  payload={
    "targetOrgId": move_org
  }
  print("Moving project "+current_proj_name+"...")
  #print(url)
  requests.request("PUT", url, headers=headers, data=payload)
  proj_count+=1
print("Project move complete. "+str(proj_count)+" projects moved.")
```
